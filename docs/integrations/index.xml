      <description>The GitHub Webhook Integration will allow you to receive notifications in Symphony for many of the important actions taken by you and others in your repositories, such as a push of new commits, the opening of a pull request, or the creation of a release.
How it works As the GitHub admin of a repository, you can configure a WebHook to post messages to a URL you generate in the GitHub Application to start receiving notifications for the supported events.</description>

      <description>The JIRA Webhook Integration will allow you to receive notifications in Symphony whenever an issue-related event occurs inside of JIRA.
How it works If you are a JIRA admin user, you can configure a JIRA WebHook (as shown in the image below) using the URL generated in the JIRA Webhook Application to begin receiving notifications for the supported events.
What formats and events it supports and what it produces Every integration will receive a message sent in a specific format (depending on the system it ingests) and will usually convert it into an internal format before it reaches the Symphony platform.</description>

      <description>The Salesforce WebHook Integration will allow you to receive notifications in Symphony when a Salesforce opportunity, account or an executive dashboard changes state.
How it works Unlike JIRA and GitHub, Salesforce does not provide out-of-the-box Webhook support. As such, while in beta, Symphony provides directly to customers an unmanaged package consisting of an Apex trigger and configuration object to achieve this functionality. As a Salesforce administrator, you can configure the unmanaged packaged with the webhook URL generated by the Salesforce Application available in the Symphony Market.</description>

      <description>The Trello WebHook Integration will allow you to receive notifications in Symphony whenever specific events, defined by you, occur in a Trello board of your choice.
Build Instructions How it works As a Symphony user you can configure a WebHook with Trello directly from the Trello WebHook Application available on Symphony Market. There you can choose which events you want to be notified from Trello, which we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in more details ahead.</description>

      <description>The Universal Webhook Integration enables you to send messages directly from any service into a Symphony conversation of your choice - either a 1:1 IM with you, or a room that you are the owner of.
How it works If you have a service that can be configured to send webhooks, all you have to do is point it to the URL you generate in the Universal Webhook Application available on Symphony Market, and setup your service to post webhook payloads to that URL, in messageML format.</description>

      <description>The Zapier WebHook Integration will allow you to add an ecosystem of 600+ apps to the Symphony platform.

See Symphony on Zapier here
How it works With access to a Zapier account, you can configure Zaps in order to receive notifications on Symphony.</description>
