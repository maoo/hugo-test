The Symphony Integrations are both a series of integrations and a framework on which you can build additional integrations.

The framework lets you build integrations on top of Symphony's secure messaging platform, by connecting Symphony to 3rd party and in-house software applications. This enables users to extend their workflows to these applications without leaving the context of Symphony; this enhances collaboration and simplifies user workflow.

Check the [integrations already available](/integrations) or follow the [quickstart to build your own](/quickstart).
